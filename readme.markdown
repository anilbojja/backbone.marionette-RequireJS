## A Sample Application featuring Backbone.Marionette with RequireJS(v2.0+)/AMD
======================================

### Check out this sample application if you need a little help using RequireJS and Backbone.Marionette.

I struggled a bit ;-) with Backbone.Marionette and RequireJS, most of my struggles were coming to grips with
configuration, so I created this repo as a means to try out a few new things.

I added the 'assetsAMD' folder, the 'assets' folder is the original fork of [David Sulc's repo](https://github.com/davidsulc/backbone.marionette-atinux-books)
Backbone.Marionette application which was based on [Atinux](http://www.atinux.fr)'s [Backbone books](http://www.atinux.fr/backbone-books/)
example app and covers some slightly advanced subjects, such as modal dialogs, sub applications, etc.

Hopefully serve as a boilerplate.

In this version I am highlighting how to setup Backbone.Marionette using RequireJS / Asyncronous Module Definition (AMD)
and external Templates in the Mustache format  {{ }} and underscore _

See the [indexAMD.html](https://github.com/t2k/bb.m-atinux-books-RequireJS/blob/master/indexAMD.html) for RequireJS startup
