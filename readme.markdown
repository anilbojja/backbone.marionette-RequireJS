Backbone.Marionette Application Example
======================================

This is an example application reimplemented to use Backbone.Marionette and serve as a tutorial.



The application is based on [Atinux](http://www.atinux.fr)'s [Backbone books](http://www.atinux.fr/backbone-books/) example app and covers some slightly advanced subjects, such as modal dialogs, sub applications, etc.
