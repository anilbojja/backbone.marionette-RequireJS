# Backbone.Marionette Application Example
======================================

## This is an example application reimplemented to use Backbone.Marionette and serve as a tutorial.



See the documentation for more information.

The application is based on [Atinux](http://www.atinux.fr)'s [Backbone books](http://www.atinux.fr/backbone-books/)
example app and covers some slightly advanced subjects, such as modal dialogs, sub applications, etc.

I've forked the repo of David Sulc in order to test RequireJS AMD loader with BackBone Marionette
In this version I am highlighting how to setup Backbone.Marionette using RequireJS / Asyncronous Module Definition (AMD)
and external Templates in the Mustache format  {{ }} and underscore _

See the [indexAMD.html](https://github.com/t2k/bb_-atinux-books-requirejs/master/indexAMD.htlm)
