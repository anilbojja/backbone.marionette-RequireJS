## Backbone.Marionette AMD/RequireJS (v2.0+) Sample Application
======================================

### Check out this sample application if you need a little help using RequireJS and Backbone.Marionette.

### I struggled alot ;-) with Backbone.Marionette and AMD, so I used this repo and a means to try out a few things.


See the the AssetsAMD folder for my stuff, the 'assets' folder is the orig. repo from David Sulc Backbone.Marionette
application which was based on [Atinux](http://www.atinux.fr)'s [Backbone books](http://www.atinux.fr/backbone-books/)
example app and covers some slightly advanced subjects, such as modal dialogs, sub applications, etc.


I've forked David Sulc's repo in order to test RequireJS AMD loader with BackBone Marionette and hopefully serve as a boilerplate.

In this version I am highlighting how to setup Backbone.Marionette using RequireJS / Asyncronous Module Definition (AMD)
and external Templates in the Mustache format  {{ }} and underscore _

See the [indexAMD.html](https://github.com/t2k/bb.m-atinux-books-RequireJS/blob/master/indexAMD.html) for RequireJS startup
