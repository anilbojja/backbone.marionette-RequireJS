It takes a more modular approach to the design and layout of the system\n\nI struggled a bit ;-) with Backbone.Marionette and RequireJS, most of my struggles were coming to grips with\nconfiguration, so I created this repo as a means to try out a few new things for my own learning purposes.\n\nI've added the **assetsAMD** folder, the **assets** folder is the original fork of [David Sulc's repo](https://github.com/davidsulc/backbone.marionette-atinux-books)\nBackbone.Marionette application which was based on [Atinux](http://www.atinux.fr)'s [Backbone books](http://www.atinux.fr/backbone-books/)\nexample app and covers some slightly advanced subjects, such as modal dialogs, sub applications, etc.\n\nHopefully others can use parts of the js/lib as a shortcut for creating your own Marionette/AMD boilerplate.\n\nIn this repo I highlighting how to setup Backbone.Marionette using RequireJS / Asyncronous Module Definition (AMD)\nand refactored a number of things from the original project to create a more modular MVC with templated views using **underscore**  with **Mustache {{}}** style templating.\n\n\nSee the [indexAMD.html](https://github.com/t2k/bb.m-atinux-books-RequireJS/blob/master/indexAMD.html) for RequireJS startup main.js\n\n"]],"start1":0,"start2":0,"length1":0,"length2":1417}]],"length":1417}
