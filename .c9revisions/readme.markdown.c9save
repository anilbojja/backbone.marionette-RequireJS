Modular AMD applications can be a blessing and a curse... at the end of the day AMD forces the developer to pursue a higly decoupled modular architecture.\n\nI've added my stuff to the **assetsAMD** folder, reworking the Backbone.Marionette application which was based on [Atinux](http://www.atinux.fr)'s [Backbone books](http://www.atinux.fr/backbone-books/)\nexample app and covers important features, such as modal dialogs, loading external templates with RequireJS and configuring Underscore to use Mustache style templates {{ xxx }},\nusing layouts and regions to load modular sub applications, etc.\n\nCheck out [indexAMD.html](https://github.com/t2k/backbone.marionette-RequireJS/blob/master/indexAMD.html) for the RequireJS startup using [assetsAMD/main.js](https://github.com/t2k/backbone.marionette-RequireJS/blob/master/assetsAMD/js/main.js)\n\nTake a look at the **assetsAMD/js/libs** folder and **assetsAMD/main.js** to see how to setup this  Marionette/AMD application.
